# Low-frequency-data-acquisition
A board design with example code for data acquisition with 14-, 16-, or 18-bit resolution at 100 up to 1000 kSPS

Supported ADCs (to be tested):
These are all the ADCs that should be supported. The footprint used is the 10-MSOP. All ADCs are either differential or pseudo-differential (check for your application).
